# Famous-Scientists
is a web page with High School aged students in mind.  High School aged students pointing toward a career in the hard science disiplines need a skill set that will help them learn along the way.  With this in mind I put this page together as a writing resource a provision of facts and routes to new research into the lives of certian famous scientists.  The background lesson is how to conduct literature research, a valuable tool when outlining a writing task and when determining where study is needed.
