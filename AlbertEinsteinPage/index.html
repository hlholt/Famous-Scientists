        <h3>A Brief Timline of Albert Einstein's Life</h3>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March
                1879.</li>
            <li>In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic
                School in Zürich </li>
            <li> In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6
                in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year
                mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich polytechnic school.</li>
            <li>He maried Mileva Maric married January 1903.</li>
            <li>He Married Elsa Lowenthal in 1919</li>
            <li>In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland, and their son Eduard was
                born in Zürich in July 1910</li>
            <li>By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of
                Bern.</li>
            <li>In 1909 he was appointed associate professor in theoretical physics.</li>
            <li>Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the
                Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey</li>
            <li>On April 17 1955, he experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic
                aneurysm,</li>

            <p>Albert Einstein 14 March 1879 to 18 April 1955)
                A German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity. Considered, alongside
                quantum mechanics, as one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is best known to the general public
                for his mass energy equivalence formula E = mc2. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his
                discovery of the photoelectric effect.</p>
            <p>The son of a salesman, young Albert was born in Germany, but moved to Switzerland in 1895. Einstein
                received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich in 1900
                specializing in physics and mathematics . The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship. After
                initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss
                Patent Office in Bern.</p>
            <p>Einstein posited that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the
                electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity while working as a
                patent clerk.
                In 1905, he published four papers, the first outlined the photoelectric effect, the second explained
                Brownian motion, the third introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass energy equivalence. During
                the same year he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.</p>
            <p>Einstein's works gradually came to be recognized by the scientific community as significant advancements.
                In 1914, he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years.
                Soon after publishing his work on special relativity, Einstein began working to extend the theory to
                gravitational fields; leading him to publish his paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his
                theory of gravitation. He continued to work on the problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory,
                leading to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the
                thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, the basics of modern laser technology.
                In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.</p>
            <p>In 1933, while visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power. Because of his Jewish background,
                Einstein chose to remain in the United States. He became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of
                World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential
                German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported
                the Allies, but generally supported the idea that nuclear weapons were the worst possible choice for
                humanity's future. Stating in a post World War 2 interview he didn't know World War 3 would be fought
                but World War 4 would be fought with sticks and stones. </p>
            <p>Einstein was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death
                in 1955. He published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. His
                achievements have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".</p>
