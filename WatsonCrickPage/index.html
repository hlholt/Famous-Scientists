        <h3>A Brief Timline of James Watson's Life</h3>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>James D. Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean and James D. Watson.</li>
            <li>Watson grew up on the south side of Chicago and attended public schools, including Horace Mann Grammar
                School and South Shore High School.</li>
            <li>Watson earned his BS degree in Zoology from the University of Chicago in 1947.</li>
            <li>He received his PhD degree from Indiana University in 1950.</li>
            <li>In mid-March 1953, Watson and Crick deduced the double helix structure of DNA.</li>
            <li>In 1956, Watson accepted a position in the Biology department at Harvard University. His work at Harvard
                focused on RNA and its role in the transfer of genetic information.</li>
            <li>In 1968, Watson wrote The Double Helix, listed by the Board of the Modern Library as number seven in
                their list of 100 Best Nonfiction books.</li>
            <li>In 1990, Watson was appointed as the Head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of
                Health, a position he held until April 10, 1992.</li>
            <li>In his memoir, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, Watson describes his academic
                colleagues as "dinosaurs," "deadbeats," "fossils," "has-beens," "mediocre," and "vapid.</li>

        <h3>A Brief Timline of Francis Crick's Life</h3>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>Crick was the first son of Harry Crick and Annie Elizabeth Crick. He was born on 8 June 1916 and raised
                in Weston Favell, then a small village near the English town of Northampton.</li>
            <li>At the age of 21, Crick earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from University College, London.
            </li>
            <li>During World War II, he worked for the Admiralty Research Laboratory on the design of magnetic and
                acoustic mines, and was instrumental in designing a new mine that was effective against German
                minesweepers.</li>
            <li>In 1947, aged 31, Crick began studying biology and became part of an important migration of physical
                scientists into biology research. </li>
            <li>In 1951 and 1952, together with William Cochran and Vladimir Vand, Crick assisted in the development of
                a mathematical theory of X-ray diffraction by a helical molecule.</li>
            <li>Late in 1951, Crick started working with James Watson at Cavendish Laboratory at the University of
                Cambridge, England.</li>
            <li>Using "Photo 51" Watson and Crick together developed a model for a helical structure of DNA, which they
                published in 1953. For this and subsequent work they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology
                or Medicine in 1962 with Wilkins.</li>
            <li>Crick died of colon cancer on the morning of 28 July 2004, at the University of California San Diego
                Thornton Hospital in La Jolla; he was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.</li>

    <article class="article">
        <p>Francis Harry Compton Crick (June 8 1916 – July 28 2004) a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and
            neuroscientist. In 1953, he co-authored with James Watson the academic paper proposing the double helix
            structure of the DNA molecule. Together with Watson and Maurice Wilkins, he was jointly awarded the 1962
            Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic
            acids and its significance for information transfer in living material". The results were based partly on
            fundamental studies done by Rosalind Franklin, Raymond Gosling and Wilkins.</p>
        <p>Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research related to
            revealing the helical structure of DNA. He is widely known for the use of the term "central dogma" to
            summarise the idea that once information is transferred from nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) to proteins, it
            cannot flow back to nucleic acids. In other words, the final step in the flow of information from nucleic
            acids to proteins is irreversible.</p>
        <p>During the remainder of his career, he held the post of J.W. Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at
            the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. His later research centered on
            theoretical neurobiology and attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness. He remained in
            this post until his death; "he was editing a manuscript on his death bed, a scientist until the bitter end"
            according to Christof Koch.</p>

    <h2>James Watson</h2>

    <img src="Images/1200px-James_D_Watson.jpg" alt="James Watson">

    <article class="article">
        <p>James Dewey Watson KBE (born April 6, 1928) an American molecular biologist, geneticist, zoologist and
            codiscoverer of the DNA double helix. In 1953, he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper
            proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the
            1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of
            nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material".</p>
        <p>Watson earned degrees at the University of Chicago (BS, 1947) and Indiana University (PhD, 1950). Following a
            post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maaløe, Watson worked at the
            University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator
            Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department,
            promoting research in molecular biology.</p>
        <p>From 1968 Watson served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, greatly expanding its level of funding
            and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a
            world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10
            years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming
            that there is a genetic link between intelligence and race. In 2019, following the broadcast of a
            documentary in which Watson reiterated these views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles
            and severed all ties with him.</p>
        <p>Watson has written many science books, including the textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965) and his
            bestselling book The Double Helix (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National
            Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project, which completed the task of mapping the
            human genome in 2003.</p>
