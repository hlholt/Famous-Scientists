    <blockquote <br>
      <p>Wegener observed the similarity of the coastlines of eastern South America and Western Africa and speculated
        that those lands had once been joined. His research led him to a hypothesis positing about 250 million years ago
        all present day continents were formed as a single large continent, or supercontinent, he named Pangaea.
        Wegener’s hypothesis became known as continental drift. He proposed the world’s continents had slowly moved
        thousands of miles apart over very long periods of time. In his work The Origin of Continents and Oceans, he was
        able to point to many closely related fossils and rock strata found to occur on widely separated continents,
        including most importantly, North and South America, and Africa.
        Wegener garnered some adherents in the years following up to his death. After his death in1930 his theory,
        having been rejected by most geologists, sank into obscurity. Wegener’s theory was given credence in the 1960’s
        with the theory of plate tectonics.
