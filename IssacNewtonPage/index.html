        <h3>A Brief Timline of Issac Newton's Life</h3>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 "an hour or two after midnight".</li>
            <li>From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham.
            </li>
            <li>In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge.</li>
            <li>His studies impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, succeeding him in 1669.</li>
            <li>He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.</li>
            <li>Newton's work distinctly advanced every branch of mathematics then studied." His work is now published
                among Newton's mathematical papers.</li>
            <li>In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum
                deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, that is, the prism refracts
                different colours by different angles.</li>
            <li>In 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on
                the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion.</li>
            <li>In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic
                interpretation of the Bible.</li>
            <li>Newton was made President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Académie des
                Sciences.</li>
            <li>Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 His body was buried in Westminster Abbey.</li>

            <p>Sir Isaac Newton PRS (December 25 1642 – March 20 1726) an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer,
                theologian, and author (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") widely recognised as one of
                the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution.</p>
            <p>His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy),
                first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to
                optics, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing calculus.</p>
            <p>In Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant
                scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical
                description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories
                of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar
                System's heliocentricity.</p>
            <p>He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the
                same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the
                geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of
                the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.</p>
            <p>Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour
                based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.
                His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704.</p>
            <p>He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of
                sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a
                mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to
                non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most
                of the cubic plane curves.</p>
            <p>Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University
                of Cambridge, a position also occupied by Steven Hawking 300 years later. He was a devout but unorthodox
                Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take holy orders in the Church
                of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study
                of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long
                after his death.</p>
            <p>Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament
                for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent
                the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of
                the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).</p>
