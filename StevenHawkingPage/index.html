      <p>Steven William Hawking an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and director of research at the
        Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death.
        He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.
        He was born in Oxford into a family of doctors. His university education began at University College, where he
        received a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in physics. His graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge culminated in
        PhD's in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specializing general relativity and cosmology.</p>
      <p>He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease at about the time he
        completed his degree work. A disorder that gradually paralyzed him over the decades.
        After the loss of his speech, he was able to communicate through a speech-generating device—initially through
        use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.</p>
      <p>Dr. Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity
        theorems in the framework of general relativity and the ground breaking hypothesis that black holes emit
        radiation.
        Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further
        research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.
        Dr. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of
        relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
        mechanics.</p>
      <p>His book, A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.
        He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient
        of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.
        In 2002, he was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died on 14 March 2018 at the
        age of 76.</p>

      <h3>A Brief Timline of Steven Hawking's Life</h3>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>Born: January 8, 1942, Oxford, United Kingdom</li>
        <li>Died: March 14, 2018, Cambridge, United Kingdom</li>
        <li>Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London.</li>
        <li>He began his university education at University College, Oxford at the age of 17.</li>
        <li>In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first
          explored in his doctoral thesis</li>
        <li>In 1979, he was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.</li>
        <li>In 1981, he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates.
        </li>
        <li> This information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate,
          including "the Black Hole War" with Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft.</li>
        <li>A film version of A Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg,
          premiered in 1992.</li>
        <li>Hawking's final paper – A smooth exit from eternal inflation? – was posthumously published in the Journal of
          High Energy Physics on 27 April 2018.</li>
