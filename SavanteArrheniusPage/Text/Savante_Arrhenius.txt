Svante August Arrhenius (February 19 1859 â€“ October 2 1927) a Swedish scientist, originally a physicist, but often referred to as a chemist.  Arrhenius was one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry.
He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903, becoming the first Swedish Nobel laureate. In 1905, he became director of the Nobel Institute, where he remained until his death.
Arrhenius was the first to use basic principles of physical chemistry to estimate the extent to which increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for the Earth's increasing surface temperature.
Arrhenius's contributions to science are memorialized by the Arrhenius equation, Arrhenius acid, lunar crater Arrhenius, Martian crater Arrhenius, the mountain of Arrheniusfjellet, and the Arrhenius Labs at Stockholm University.

Arrhenius was born on 19 February 1859 at Vik, near Uppsala, the son of Svante Gustav and Carolina Thunberg Arrhenius.

At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read without the encouragement of his parents, and by watching his father's addition of numbers in his account books, became an arithmetical prodigy.

In 1884, based on this work on the conductivities of electrolytes, he submitted a 150-page dissertation on electrolytic conductivity to Uppsala for the doctorate. It did not impress the professors, and he received a fourth-class degree, but upon his defense it was reclassified as third-class. Later, extensions of the same work would earn him the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

In 1884, as an extension of his ionic theory, Arrhenius proposed definitions for acids and bases.

In 1885, Arrhenius next received a travel grant from the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which enabled him to study with Ostwald in Riga.

In 1889, Arrhenius formulated the concept of activation energy explaining the fact that most reactions require added heat energy to proceed.

In 1891, he became a lecturer at the Stockholm University College, was promoted to professor of physics in 1895, and rector in 1896

About 1900, Arrhenius became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the Nobel Prizes. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1901.

He was elected an Honorary Member of the Netherlands Chemical Society in 1909.

He became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1910.

In 1912, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1919, he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In September 1927, he came down with an attack of acute intestinal catarrh and died on 2 October. He was buried in Uppsala.
